# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpose :
On this module activity, we use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

# Objective: 
   - Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
   - Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
   - Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
   - Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
   - Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
   - Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
   - Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
   - Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
    -Render maps on a local server.
